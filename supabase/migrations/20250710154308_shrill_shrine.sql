  # Admin Account Setup Migration
  
  Note: This migration creates placeholder data structures.
  Actual admin account creation is handled via:
  1. Google OAuth (primary authentication method)
  2. setup-demo-users.js script (backup admin account)
  
  The DevAdminPortal provides role switching capabilities for testing
  different user types without multiple accounts.

-- Migration compatibility placeholder
-- Actual user creation will be handled by OAuth setup

-- Ensure chamber ownership can be assigned to admin user
-- This will be updated when admin user is created via OAuth
UPDATE chambers 
SET user_id = NULL
WHERE id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
  AND user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Note: Chamber memberships, business profiles, and user profiles 
-- will be created dynamically via setup-demo-users.js script
-- after admin account is established through Google OAuth

-- This approach provides:
-- 1. Single admin account with role switching via DevAdminPortal
-- 2. Test access to chamber_admin, business_owner, and super_admin roles
-- 3. Flexibility for OAuth integration without hardcoded credentials
